# RFM

RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency and monetary total of their recent transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing campaigns. I have performed RFM analysis on online retail data set from UCI machine learning repository.

## Clustering
Clustering is used to determine the internal grouping in a set of unlabeled data. 
The most common applications of clustering is customer segmentation. And it isnâ€™t just limited to banking. This strategy is across functions, including telecom, e-commerce, sports, advertising, sales, etc.

K-means is a centroid-based algorithm, or a distance-based algorithm, where we calculate the distances to assign a point to a cluster. In K-Means, each cluster is associated with a centroid.The main objective of the K-Means algorithm is to minimize the sum of distances between the points and their respective cluster centroid.
